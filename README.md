# HTML Templates
A collection of templates including HTML, CSS, and more to come!

## Purpose
I will be using these files to help me with practicing [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). They may be useful for other applications, too.

These files are organized according to their usage within the Flask microframework. HTML files are in the `templates` directory. CSS files (and possibly JavaScript in the future) are in the `static` directory.

## Usage
If you would like to use these template files, you can clone the repository by opening a shell prompt (like Git Bash) and running `$ git clone https://github.com/davidhammaker/HTML_Template_for_Flask.git`. You can also [download](https://github.com/davidhammaker/HTML_Template_for_Flask/archive/master.zip) the repository.
